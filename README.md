# PRODIGY_CS_02
An image encryption tool in Python using pixel manipulation. Allows user to encrypt and decrypt images.

Just upload your image by replacing "your_image_here.jpg" in the code at line 61 with your original image path which you want to excrypt. It is recommended you keep the image file you want to encrypt in the same directory of the code itself. Run the code and it generates the encrypted and the decrypted image of the uploaded file.
